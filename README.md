# Loan Repayment Predictions

## Project Topic
This project will be focused on identifying/predicting whether a particpant might default on their loan.  We are using this topic to better understand the loan approval process and the factors used to make a decision when granting a loan.

## Description of Data
The data used is from Lending Club for all loans issued in 2017, including the current loan status (Current, Late, Fully Paid, etc.) and latest payment information. The CSV file contains 122 columns and 96,779 rows.

## Machine Learning
We will be using a Supervised Learning Machine Model to make our predictions as we have a known outcome.  The data will be put into a Classification algorithm to learn the patterns based on factors such as income, credit status and more.  

## Database 
We will be using a SQL database to import the data into tables for manipulation.  Those tables will then be exported back into separate CSV files and used for visualizations in Tableau.

## Technologies to be used
